# User-mode access to cycle counters in ARM PMU and CNTVCT timer

This repository contains a kernel module and library.

ARM performance monitor units (PMUs) are only available on ARMv7 machines. In
general, this means you'll need a Cortex-A7 or better (A8, A9, A15, etc.)

More details are available in [my blog post][blog].
